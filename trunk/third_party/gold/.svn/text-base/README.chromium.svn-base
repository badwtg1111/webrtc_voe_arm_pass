Description:
This directory contains a binary of the gold linker from GNU binutils.
It was built from binutils-2.21.1 on 64-bit Ubuntu Lucid as follows:

1) Fetch tarball: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.21.1.tar.bz2
2) Unpack, then
    ./configure --enable-gold=default --enable-threads
3) make maybe-all-gold; strip gold/ld-new
4) mv gold/ld-new path/to/this/dir/gold64

(ld.bfd is a forwarding script that is in place because the NaCl build
depends on there being a script with that name in the same directory as
ld.)
